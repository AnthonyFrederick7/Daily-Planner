# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

[Link to Daily Planner](https://github.com/AnthonyFrederick7/Daily-Planner)

The Work Day Scheduler was made to be an easily usuable planner during the work day.

The scheduler keeps track of the time and date and is easily visible to see what time block you are currently on.

  - Grey -> Past

  - Red -> Current hour

  - Green -> Future

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

If you have a task/plan, you can type it in the time block in which you feel you need to accomplish it.

When you're done typing your task you can save the task via the blue save button at the end of the hour block.

If you have to refresh the page or close the page you will still see the items to do via local save storage.

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
